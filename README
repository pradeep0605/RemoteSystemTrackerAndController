This project is built to track set of client in a single server. The server has the 
ability to control all the connected clients in the LAN. Server gets the client 
screen shots for every second and also all the tasks which are running. Server can 
run any new programs in the client or kill any. Server can access any file in the
clients and can copy it. Server is also capable of doing something like a remote login,
where all the keyboard inetrrupts are sent to the client; This gives an illusion of 
remote login. 

I haven't written any mvn or make file to compile the project (its very old, 2009 - 2010).
As class files run in any system, Existing installation scripts should run.

In 'RSTC Complete Installation' directory, run RSTCSetup.exe.

There are installtion files which you can use to install the server and client.
Install server on one machine in the LAN and clients on whichever machines you want
to track.


Note: This project was created with windows in mind. This might not run on Linux
(I have tried running, it has some issues).
